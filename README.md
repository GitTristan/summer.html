# Intro to HTML/CSS/JS

__Goal: to get you ready to jump into HTML, CSS, and Javascript.__

Please read this entire document before getting started.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository (go to https://github.com/gschool/precourse and click "Fork")
1. Clone your forked repository onto your computer: `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/precourse`
1. Open the `website` folder and write your assignment code there.

## Your Assignment

Build a simple website with some constraints.

### Two Pages

Pick a person, animal, or idea that is important in your life (this can be real or made up), and build a website about them. The website should have two pages linked with anchor tags. The home page should be a biography about your subject, and the second page should be a photo gallery of the subject.

Example content for page one:

> Hi there! My name is Zelda. I was born into royalty and spend my nights and weekends battling evil. My closest friend is Link. Together we will rule the world.

> Here is a picture of us fighting Gannon. [insert photo]

Example content for page two:

> [Photo] <- Description of said photo, * n

You should do your own research on how to get a simple website going, but here is a [good starting place](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/).

### Custom CSS
The site's HTML should include an external, linked stylesheet with custom CSS. The design you come up with should represent your subject's personality. Colors, borders, layout, fonts, sizes, etc. is up to you!

Note that the CSS should be linked to from a separate CSS file. For more information on how to do this, refer to [this article on the subject](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/adding-css-to-html-with-link-embed-inline-and-import).

### Use jQuery
The site should use jQuery to change something on the page when a user clicks a button. The button can say or do anything, but it must be handled using jQuery.

You can learn more [about jQuery online](http://try.jquery.com/).

### Valid Markup
All markup must be valid through the W3C validator.

To validate your website, visit [the validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload), click "Choose file", upload your HTML file, and click "Check". You should validate each HTML file in your website.

The validator will provide a list of warnings and errors. It's okay if your website has warnings, but there should be *no* errors when you are done with your site.

## How to hand-in/submit the assignments.
When finished, submit your website with a pull request. Even if you do not finish the assignment before Tuesday, please submit what you have.
