    <h1>Hi My Name is Summer Skye</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Summer Skye, I'm almost 3 and I like to go "Super Dooper Fast" on my Strider.
        I enjoy waking my parents up early in the morning and wtching "Tyo - The Fiendly Bus".
        My favorite food is peanut butter and gummy bears.  I recently started swearing and think
        it's hilarious.</p>
    <p> </p>


    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I was born on July 3rd and was 8 lbs.  I had a full head of hair and I came out so fast the doctor barely
    got there in time to catch me.</p>
    <p> </p>
