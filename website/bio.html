      <h1>I'm Summer Skye</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Summer Skye Rubadeau, I'm almost 3 and I like to go <i>"Super Dooper Fast"</i> on my Strider.
          I enjoy waking my parents up early in the morning and wtching <i>"Tayo - The Fiendly Bus"</i>.
          My favorite food is peanut butter and gummy bears.  I recently started swearing and think
          it's hilarious.</p>
      <p> </p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I was born on July 3rd and was 8 lbs.  I had a full head of hair and I came out so fast the
           doctor barely got there in time to catch me.</p>
        <p> </p>
